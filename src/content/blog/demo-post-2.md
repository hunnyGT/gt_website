Deep Learning, Machine Learning, what’s this buzz is all about, why you started hearing all these terms all of sudden lately, whether people understand or not, they all wanted to know more about it, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter is filled with Artificial assistant, Neural Network videos.

Also, a lot of people are confused between machine learning and deep learning.
<b>Machine learning</b> is not new actually, it was coined in 1959, by Arthur Samuel. He defined Machine learning as “field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. Machine Learning refers to a lot of things.

Then you would ask what is a <b>Deep Learning</b>, Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning. Technically Deep Learning is new Machine Learning, It’s a new way of making a system/machine to learn. Earlier Machine Learning was using traditional algorithms to learn things, whereas Deep Learning uses Neural Network to learn things.

Now,<b> Neural Network</b> is an exact mimic of your brain cells. Like your brain is interconnected with neurons, the role of neurons in your brain is to understand things and pass it over to other neurons, and in this way, your receiver understands what you are seeing, tasting, hearing and touching. Likewise, an Artificial Neural Network works. It also has neurons that do exact work. Each neuron is capable of learning and passes it over.

Deep learning models are performing better results with Neural networks than Machine learning traditional algorithms. These day’s people are switching deep learning over traditional machine learning algorithms. Machine learning is better for performing on small data, also we have to do feature extraction manually, whereas in Deep learning it performs very well on large data set. Also, Deep learning needs heavy computational power to prefer GPU.

The machine’s like a self-driving car, facebook’s Auto-tagging, Automation, Disease detection, Voice detection, Sentimental analysis, Deep learning is performing better than traditional ML.

Deep learning is surprising us each and every day and will continue to do so in the near future. This is because Deep Learning is proving to be one of the best techniques to be discovered with state-of-the-art performances.
